<h2>Introduction to Cryptography</h2>
<p class="info">Cryptography is a method of securing communication to prevent third parties 
    from being able to discern the meaning. To make messages secure, algorithms are created 
that are meant to encode a message. Then, for the message to be decoded, an algorithm will have a
 process which will decode it to get back to the original message.
<br>
<br>
 There are multiple types of cryptography, two of which being Asymmetric key and Symmetric key.
 Asymmetric key cryptography is often called public key cryptography which is done using two keys. 
 In this case, a person would have two keys which are related to one another: a public key which 
 can be accessed by anyone wishing to send them a message, and a private key that only the person knows.
 The public key is specific to the recipient and is used by the sender to encrypt the message.
 When the encrypted message is recieved, the recipient can use their private key 
 (which is related to the public key) to decrypt the message.
<br><br>
A common algorithm for asymmetric key is the <a href="RSAinfo.html">RSA algorithm</a>, which uses prime numbers, 
ideally very large prime numbers for the strongest encryption. This will involve the 
use of modular division as well.
